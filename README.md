# Portfolio Website

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website:  
üåê **https://viraj-dhane.github.io/**

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

It was a great experience customizing and tailoring the template to reflect my own style and story. In the process, I enhanced my understanding of responsive web design and front-end fundamentals.

The website highlights:
- My background in Data Analytics and Business Intelligence
- Skills in tools like SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, and cloud platforms
- Selected projects hosted on GitHub
