# Portfolio Website

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website:  
üåê **https://viraj-dhane.github.io/**

The website is built using HTML, CSS, JaveScript, React, and Vite.

It was a great experience customizing and tailoring the template to reflect my own style and story. In the process, I enhanced my understanding of responsive web design and front-end fundamentals.

The website highlights:
- My background in Data Analytics and Business Intelligence
- Skills in SQL, Python, Tableau, Power BI, and cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Data Analytics and Engineering projects hosted on GitHub
